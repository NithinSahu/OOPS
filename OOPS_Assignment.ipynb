        "\n",
        "###1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Classes and Objects: Bundling data and behaviors together.\n",
        "2. Reusable Building Blocks: Mimics real-world entities, promoting extensibility and maintainability.\n",
        "3. Loose Coupling: Minimizes cascading impacts of changes, making code more manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that combines data (attributes or fields) with the actions or behaviors that can be performed on that data (methods or functions). It's essentially an instance of a class, a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects of that type.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential functionalities of an object, while encapsulation bundles data and methods within a single unit (like a class) and controls access to those elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "###5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (dunders) at the beginning and end of their names, such as _ _ init _ _, _ _ str _ _ , and _ _ len _ _ .\n",
        "- They enable classes to define how they should behave with built-in Python operators and functions. By implementing dunder methods in your classes, you can customize how objects are created, represented, and interact with operations like addition, comparison, and indexing.\n",
        "\n",
        "###6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (derived or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "###7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling them to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "###8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in Python, we do not have keywords like public, private, and protected, as in the case of Java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "###9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "-  A constructor is a special method within a class that initializes the attributes of an object when the object is created. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated. The constructor method in Python is named _ _ init _ _.\n",
        "- Its primary purpose is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
        "- Every class in Python has a constructor, even if it is not explicitly defined. If a constructor is not defined, Python provides a default constructor.\n",
        "Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "###10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class Methods vs Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class Methods:\n",
        "    - Bound to the class, receives cls as first argument.\n",
        "    - Can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "    - Defined using @classmethod.\n",
        "2. Static Methods:\n",
        "    - Not bound to class or instance, no special first argument.\n",
        "    - Cannot access or modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "    - Defined using @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "###11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method Overloading in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not directly supported like in Java or C++.\n",
        "2. Achieved through flexible argument handling:\n",
        "    - Default arguments\n",
        "    - Variable-length arguments\n",
        "    - Conditional logic within a single method definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "###12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is a mechanism where a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows subclasses to customize the behavior of inherited methods while maintaining the same method signature as the superclass\n",
        "\n",
        "###13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-Property Decorator in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Allows methods to be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "2. Encapsulates attribute access and modification with custom logic.\n",
        "3. Uses @property for getters, @<property_name>.setter for setters, and @<property_name>.deleter for deleters.\n",
        "\n",
        "###14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Write code that works with different object types.\n",
        "2. Flexibility: Easily add new features or classes without modifying existing code.\n",
        "3. Simplified Development: More concise and readable code.\n",
        "4. Easier Maintenance: Modify or extend code without affecting existing working code.\n",
        "\n",
        "###15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "- It defines methods that subclasses must implement, ensuring a consistent interface.\n",
        "- Abstract classes are created using the abc module and the ABC class, with abstract methods marked using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "###16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Benefits of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modularity: Easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
        "2. Code Reusability: Reduces duplication through inheritance.\n",
        "3. Flexibility: Polymorphism allows uniform treatment of different objects.\n",
        "4. Scalability: Easier to add new features without major modifications.\n",
        "5. Simplified Debugging: Encapsulation and modularity help isolate bugs.\n",
        "6. Security: Encapsulation protects data from unauthorized access.\n",
        "7. Productivity: Features like reusability and debugging efficiency boost productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "###17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance Variables vs Class Variables:\n",
        "  - Scope: Instance variables are specific to each instance, while class variables are shared among all instances.\n",
        "  - Declaration: Instance variables are defined in __init__ using self, while class variables are defined outside methods.\n",
        "  - Access: Instance variables use self.variable_name, while class variables use ClassName.variable_name or instance_name.variable_name.\n",
        "  - Mutability: Instance variables have unique values per instance, while class variables have the same value across all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "###18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "- Enables combining functionalities from different classes.\n",
        "- Creates a more versatile and reusable class structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "###19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- *_ _str _ _ vs  _ _ repr _ _ :*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *_ _ str _ _*: Returns a human-readable string for end-users (e.g., print()).\n",
        "2. *__repr__*: Returns a formal, unambiguous string for developers (e.g., debugging, logging).\n",
        "3. If _ _ str _ _ is not defined, Python uses _ _ repr _ _ as a fallback.\n",
        "\n",
        "###20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- *The super() Function:*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Calls parent class methods in a child class.\n",
        "2. Enables method overriding and extension.\n",
        "3. Useful for:\n",
        "    - Calling superclass constructors (__init__)\n",
        "    - Overriding methods while extending functionality\n",
        "    - Managing method resolution order in multiple inheritance\n",
        "4. Promotes code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "###21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- *The __del__ Method:*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Defines actions when an object is garbage collected.\n",
        "2. Used for cleanup of resources (e.g., closing files, network connections).\n",
        "3. Unpredictable timing and potential issues make it less reliable.\n",
        "4. Recommended to use context managers or explicit cleanup methods instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "###22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "1. *@staticmethod*:\n",
        "    - Regular function inside a class.\n",
        "    - No access to class or instance state.\n",
        "    - Useful for utility functions.\n",
        "2. *@classmethod*:\n",
        "    - Receives the class as the first argument (cls).\n",
        "    - Can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "    - Useful for factory methods or class-level operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "###23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.\n",
        "2. Achieved through method overriding in inheritance, where a subclass redefines a parent class method.\n",
        "3. Enables writing uniform code that works with objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
        "4. Python dynamically determines the correct method implementation to execute based on the object's actual class.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Method Chaining in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Allows multiple methods to be called on an object in a single line.\n",
        "2. Enhances code readability and conciseness.\n",
        "3. Achieved by having each method return the object instance (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "###25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- *The __call__ Method:*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions using the () syntax.\n",
        "2. Makes objects \"callable\" and allows them to behave like functions.\n",
        "3. Useful for creating objects that need to maintain state while being used like functions.\n",
        "4. Often used in scenarios like function-like objects, decorators, or when an object needs to perform an action when called."
